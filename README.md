## 🛠 The Tech Stack
* Frontend: Vanilla HTML5, Modern CSS3 (CSS Variables, Flexbox, Grid)
* Animation Engine: [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (GreenSock Animation Platform)
* Deployment: GitHub Pages
* SEO & Optimization: XML Sitemaps, Robots.txt, and OG Tag integration

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Interactive Card Stack 🃏
A custom-built "Demo" section using absolute positioning and CSS variables to create a 3D depth effect.
* Dynamic Entry: Cards "deal" themselves onto the screen from left to right on scroll.
* Active States: Clicking or navigating moves a card to the front with a high-scale pop-out effect.

### 2. Kinetic Typography ✍️
The "Bespoke Features" text rotator uses a GSAP timeline to swap features vertically, creating a "slot machine" scrolling effect.

### 3. DNA Helix Loader 🧪
A custom pre-loader built with GSAP modifiers that simulates a rotating double helix, ensuring a smooth entrance while heavy assets (like background videos) initialize.

### 4. Architectural SEO 🔍
* Sitemap.xml: Fully indexed paths for the homepage and product pages.
* Robots.txt: Optimized for global crawlers and specific AI bot invitations (GPTBot, Google-Extended).
